# Home-Asset-Inventory
This is just a basic home asset inventory system.

It is created within a virtual environment. So the pip package should be in there.

# 1. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env

# 2. Activate the virtual environment
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
# .\env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows

# 3. Install Flask
pip install Flask

# (Optional) 4. Save dependencies to requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt
